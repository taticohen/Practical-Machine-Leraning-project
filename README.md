# Practical-Machine-Leraning-project
My project

Hi, Welcome to my Practical Machine Learning Project Repository!
Thanks for visiting!

I have uploaded my WriteUp submission files both to the Master and gh-pages branches on this repository, for your convenience. 

You will find the Rmarkdown file as well as the HTML file, which include all of the steps I have taken as part of the practical machine learning final prediction project. 

Hope you have a great week!
